# equal-twitter

This is a Chrome extension to set everyone in Twitter verified or unverified. Of course, since this is a Chrome extension, it only affects you. Unless your friends know and use this extension, too.

Technical-wise, it's not the most advanced Chrome extension you'll ever see, but hey, it gets the job done!
