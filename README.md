# Tokopedia Extra

This is a Chrome extension that will give you extra features, such as showing total items sold when you browse/search for products in Tokopedia. Well, showing total items sold in the products list is the only feature it has as of now :p

Because it relies on the classes on the elements rendered in the DOM, it might not work anywhere (right now, it only works for when you search for products in Tokopedia, not in your wishlist/feed/etc). But I think it is quite useful as it saves you a click when you want to know the trustability of the sellers.
